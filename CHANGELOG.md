- **Root Cause**: `DiscoverSchedulers` method was called but not implemented
- **Fix**: Implemented complete CoreDNS discovery mechanism
- **Impact**: Enables dynamic scheduler discovery instead of static configuration

#### **Reconciliation Bug Fix**
- **Root Cause**: The reconciliation loop was not correctly updating workload states or handling certain edge cases, leading to inconsistencies between desired and actual workload states.
- **Fix**: Refactored the reconciliation logic to ensure accurate state comparison, proper update of workload status, and robust handling of all reconciliation actions (recreate, restart, stop).
- **Impact**: Ensures the reconciliation system maintains state consistency and self-healing as intended, with improved reliability and observability.

#### **Workload State Management**
- **Root Cause**: No mechanism to track desired vs actual workload state

### üõ†Ô∏è CoreDNS & Service Discovery Troubleshooting

#### **Recent Lessons and Improvements (2024-06)**
- **CoreDNS/etcd Integration:**
  - Ensured CoreDNS is configured to serve the correct zone (e.g., `persys.local`) from etcd, matching the service registration and discovery domains.
  - Verified that SRV and A records are correctly written to etcd and that CoreDNS is able to return them for service discovery queries.
  - Updated Corefile configuration to explicitly include the correct zone and etcd endpoints, resolving issues where records were present in etcd but not returned by CoreDNS.
  - Added the command to CoreDNS to use the correct config files
  - Exposed CoreDNS prometheus metrics
- **API Gateway & Prow Discovery Logic:**
  - Improved the API Gateway's service discovery logic to use CoreDNS for dynamic scheduler discovery, with robust fallback to static configuration if discovery fails.
  - Fixed the parsing of SRV records so that the SRV target is resolved to an IP address before establishing mTLS connections, preventing connection errors when using service names.
  - Enhanced error handling and logging for DNS and service discovery failures, making troubleshooting easier.
  - Added configuration options for `DiscoveryDomain` and `DiscoveryService` in the API Gateway for flexible discovery setup.
- **General Troubleshooting Steps:**
  - Emphasized the importance of matching the domain used in both service registration (by prow) and discovery (by api-gateway).
  - Documented the process of checking etcd keys, CoreDNS logs, and DNS queries to ensure end-to-end service discovery is functioning as expected.

These changes and lessons have resulted in a more robust, production-ready service discovery system, with clear troubleshooting steps and improved observability for future debugging.

### üöÄ Observability & Instrumentation Improvements (2024-06)

- **Full OpenTelemetry Tracing:**
  - All outgoing HTTP requests in both `prow` and `api-gateway` are now instrumented with OpenTelemetry, including:
    - Agent API calls
    - Handshake requests
    - Certificate signing requests to CFSSL
  - All distributed traces are now visible in your tracing backend (e.g., Jaeger).
- **Prometheus Metrics:**
  - The API Gateway now exposes Prometheus metrics for all endpoints, including mTLS traffic, by instrumenting both mTLS and non-mTLS routers.
- **Reconciliation & Monitoring Bugfixes:**
  - Fixed grace period logic in the reconciler to prevent runaway container launches.
  - Improved container state reporting and monitoring, ensuring accurate status (Running, Exited, Pulling, etc.) is always reported and visible in both etcd and the UI.
- **Certificate Management:**
  - CertificateManager in both services now includes OpenTelemetry tracing for all certificate requests, improving visibility into certificate provisioning and renewal flows.
