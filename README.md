## Architecture

* **this is the system design that i came up with, a high level mind map to look at.**
* feel free to open an ISSUE mentioning any problems or ideas you might have!

  ![](docs/architecture/milx-cloud.drawio.png)

* **an over simplified request flow**

  ![](docs/architecture/arch-flow.drawio.png)

## Local Development

* First clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/persys-dev/persys-devops
```

### Docker-Compose

* Then using make file you can do :

```shell
make up
```

**this initializes the project on a local docker environment using docker-compose**

### Kind

* As an alternative way you can use make which will build and deploy the project to a kind environment:

```shell
make kind
```

**this will build every docker file locally tag it and generate kubernetes deployment files and deploying them.**

### ShellScript

* if you don't have make just run the following commands to use the initialization script.

````shell
chmod +x /.init.sh
/.init.sh
````

**PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE : Docker , Kubectl , Kind to run the project in you desired environment.**

## Getting started

**you can use pure http rest requests/ CLI client to interact with our platform.**
<br>
<br>
**to keep it very simple:**
<br>

* download the CLI client or use Postman to interact with our api.
* login using gitHub oAuth.
* the application will read all of your repositories and list them so you can add them to your pipeline.
* our servers will prepare a kubernetes as a service for you or connect to your cloud provider.
* then we'll read your pipeline details from root of your repo and initialize all your required services for your app.if theres no pipeline manifest we will let you know!
* then add personal access tokens and set webhooks for your repositories.
* you can run a pipeline manually but when the application adds webhook to your repo you simply just need to push your code to github!
* push your code to github!
* monitor the building , tests , security , deployment!
* notify the project owner and/or your team!
  <br>
**that's it now you have a ci/cd pipeline + production environment!**
  <br>
  **refer to [getting-started.md](https://github.com/miladhzzzz/persys-cicd/docs/getting-started.md) for a better understanding of how this software works!**
